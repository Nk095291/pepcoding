word finding :- trie are very good for word finding because they take O(s) for pre-processing and then take O(p) time for finding the word.
pattern matching :- 
	1.using tries
	2.using z algo
	3.using kmp algo

	using trie :- we can solve pattern matching problem with the help of trie in O(s^2) time for pre- processing  and then O(p) time for finding the pattern in the trie
				how :- simply add all the substring of 1st element in it 
				ex- cocoa
					then add
					cocoa
					ocoa
					coa
					oa
					a
					then the trie will become like this

							|---&-------|
							c 	o---|   a
					|---o 	    c 	a
					c 	a		o
				o 				a
			a

			z algo :- with the help of this we can solve pattern matching in O(s+p) time
				how: 1.make a string str = pat + # + source
					2. then make it
